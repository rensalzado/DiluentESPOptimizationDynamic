# DiluentESPOptimizationDynamic

TEP4240 â€“ NTNU, Energy and Process Engineering Department, Subject: System Simulation

  Final course project: Diluent Injection in Production Systems with ESP-Lifted Wells

  The objective of the project was to simulate a system using Bond-graph representations
  The model provides a way to observe the dynamic behavior of the system. 

  This reposity includes:
   - Classes codes
   - Simulation main file
   - Final project report
